# OOPs2-Assignment
In this project I have defined a class named Person and mix it with Ordered Trait to do the comparison.
First, I have checked:
-> if the name parameter of both objects is equal. 
     -> If yes, then do the comparison according to age.
-> if name is not equal then do the comparison based on name length.
